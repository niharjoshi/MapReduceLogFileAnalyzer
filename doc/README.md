# Homework 2 - LogFileGenerator

## Introduction
In this assignment, we will explore the Hadoop File System and execute MapReduce programs in it - first on 
out local machine and then on AWS EMR clusters.

As a starting point, we have been given a code snippet to generate custom log files of a specified format 
along with an application configuration to tune our log file generator output. The program also injects a 
random regular expression string into the log message text based on a predefined probability. In general, 
a log file generated by this code looks like this:

```console
12:00:03.551 [main] INFO  GenerateLogData$ - Log data generator started...
12:00:03.888 [main] WARN  HelperUtils.Parameters$ - Max count 500 is used to create records instead of timeouts

.
.
.
12:00:11.872 [main] INFO  GenerateLogData$ - Log data generation has completed after generating 500 records.
```

In this assignment, we will generate many such logs and run MapReduce algorithms on them in order to 
calculate the following metrics:
- Distribution of different types of logs across predefined time intervals for logs with the injected regex
- Time intervals with most ERROR messages sorted in descending order for logs with the injected regex
- Number of log messages for each type of log message: INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR
- Number of characters in each log message type having the highest number of characters for logs with the injected regex
